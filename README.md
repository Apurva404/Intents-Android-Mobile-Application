# Intents-Android-Mobile-Application
This app demonstrates how to start an activity from another activity using implicit intents (viz. ACTION_VIEW and ACTION_DIAL).
This android app provides the facility to launch any web URL, and ring any phone number. 
Few important features of the application are:
1. Auto inserts http:// or https:// in front of the user input URL (if missing),
2. Provides the user an interface to choose a browser, if multiple browsers are installed on the system and none of them is set as the default browser,
3. Provides the user a number pad instead of a generic keyboard to enter the phone number.
